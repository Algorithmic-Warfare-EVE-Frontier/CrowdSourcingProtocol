Maybe we can find some terminology that is more in tune with the game theme.

What is the game theme?

Thermodynamics, topology, spacetime, information, ...

For the terminology, I found some initial elements.

- Project - Vector
    - CROWDING - Gathering Potential
    - FUNDING - Kinetic Discharge
- Request - Motion
- Vote - Force
- Contributor - Potential

I am inclined to consider these "Vectors" as associated to an insight and if so they would be better off as an NFT (ERC720) which represent ownership over the project.

Then, each project would have its own FT (ERC20).

Now about the frontend.

- How is the connection to the wallet established?
- How do we communicate with the deployed world?
  - We need to know the world address.
  - Also, its ABI.
- What is the part that deals with the Smart Object Aspect?
- What is the part about our functionality?
- How the contract get attached to a given SSU?
  - There is explicity mention of it except that
