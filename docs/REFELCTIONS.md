Maybe we can find some terminology that is more in tune with the game theme.

What is the game theme?

Thermodynamics, topology, spacetime, information, ...

For the terminology, I found some initial elements.

- Project - Vector
    - CROWDING - Gathering Potential
    - FUNDING - Kinetic Discharge
- Request - Motion
- Vote - Force
- Contributor - Potential

I am inclined to consider these "Vectors" as associated to an insight and if so they would be better off as an NFT (ERC720) which represent ownership over the project.

Then, each project would have its own FT (ERC20).
