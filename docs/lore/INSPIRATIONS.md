# Crude Matter

Crude Matter is a group of exotic materials with unique attributes colloquially referred to as Still-effects. Its by-products are employed in a broad range of applications, from computing to energy generation (see Exotronics, Ergodic Reactor, Symmetry Drive etc.).

Crude Matter is primarily recovered by Rifting. A rift is a compact region of spacetime with twisted polarization which is topologically related to a wormhole (see Crude Rifts).

Raw Crude Matter is generally classified by its age (old to young) and its strength (weak to strong). During refinement, Crude Matter particles are contained in lattice structures to produce stable materials ready for further processing and use. During this process, amalgamation with regular matter produces further advanced composites.

The origins of Crude Matter are poorly understood. Its properties suggest a direct relationship to Stillness, but no consensus has been reached to date. The long-term effects of Crude Matter extraction are unclear and are often challenged.

While the economic effects of Crude Matter have contributed to explosive growth in a broad range of sectors, its exploitation has been a source of internal and inter-state conflicts. The public discourse around the hypothetical underpinnings of its downstream technologies has also led to widespread social division (see Panpsychist Extremism).

# The Stillness

The Stillness is a common term for the hypothetical topological field structure out of which space-time emerges. Despite a lack of consensus on the nature of Stillness (see Stillness interpretations), associated experimental developments have yielded a range of important technologies (see Ergodic Reactor, Exotronics etc.).

While Stillness shows a high degree of correlation with the topology of space-time, Still-effects also demonstrate properties of non-locality, which makes them indispensable for FTL applications.

The study of Stillness is at the forefront of theoretical physics, with active research ongoing across multiple sub-disciplines (see Teleonomic Hypothesis, Knot Theory of Reality, Exohedron etc.).
